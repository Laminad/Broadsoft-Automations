# Midnight

Digitizitation of an old dice game called Midnight or 1, 4, 24. 

The rules of the game are fairly simple.

The primary objective is to get a 1 and a 4 along with 4 6s or 24.

If the player doesn't have a 1 and 4 by the last roll of their turn they bust. 
Also, the player must keep at least 1 die each roll, but can keep all 6 die in a single turn as well.

The current version is v1 and is only termial based at this time.

I am trying to figure out the best way to create a functional UI for v2 currently.
Any suggestions for UI implementations are definitely welcome.

Enjoy!
